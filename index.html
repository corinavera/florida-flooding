        <h1><u>Florida Flooding</u></h1>
        <p>
          Almost every day of the year, some areas of the United States and its
          territories are threatened by flooding, especially states such as
          Florida. As a matter of fact, one of Florida's main hazards is
          flooding. It poses a year-round threat that extends from coast to
          coast. Anywhere it rains, a flood could happen.
        </p>
        <p>
          With more than 650 miles of beaches, over 1,100 miles of stunning
          coastline, a humid subtropical climate in the north, and a tropical
          climate in the south, Florida has it all. Florida has more rivers,
          streams, and waterways than any other state in the nation, with an
          average annual rainfall of 59.21 inches, yet because of its flat
          terrain, it floods more frequently than any other state in the union.
        </p>
        <p>
          Knowing what to do before, during, and after a flood will help you
          safeguard your property and boost your chances of survival. For
          instance, knowing what to do if you are traveling and come across a
          flooded road or knowing what to do when instructed to leave right away
          is crucial.

         <u>Don’t ignore the “Turn Around Don’t Drown” Warning signs!</u> 
        </h3>
        <p>
          Every year, floods cause more deaths compared to any other
          thunderstorm-related disaster. According to the Centers for Disease
          Control and Prevention, driving a car into unsafe flood water results
          in more than half of all drownings caused by flooding. Walking into or
          close to flood waters results in the second-highest percentage of
          flood-related fatalities. The strength and power of water are often
          underrated. Numerous fatalities involve vehicles that are washed
          downstream. Many of these drownings may be avoided. Never go around
          the barricades that are in the way of a flooded road. The road may
          have collapsed underneath that water. A mere 6 inches of fast-moving
          flood water can knock over an adult. Most vehicles can be carried away
          by rushing water in just 12 inches of water, and SUVs and trucks can
          be carried away by rushing water in just 2 feet of water.

        <h3><u>How Do I Maintain Myself and My Family Safe During a Flood?</u></h3>
        <p>
          Prior to the flood coming to your area: 
        </p>
        <ul>
  <li>Discover whether floodwaters could harm your home and property. Know how high you are above flood stage. </li>
  <li>Create an emergency strategy for flooding. </li>
  <li>If you're instructed to leave right away, do so. Bring critical paperwork with you. </li>
  <li>Before access is cut off, move to a safe location. </li>
  <li>Follow the news to be informed on the state of the roads. </li>        
</ul>
        <p>During the flood:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Avoid regions that may flood. Never try to cross moving water.</li>
  <li>Never go driving on a flooded road. </li>
  <li>Barricades are placed there for your protection; do not drive around them.</li>
  <li>If your car stalls, get out right away.</li>
  <li>Never attempt to cross a flooded area or let kids play there.</li>        
</ul>
        
        <p>After the flood: </p>
        
  <ul>
  <li>Avoid going to disaster zones because you might interfere with rescue operations.</li>
  <li>Food that has come into contact with floodwater should be thrown out, and drinking water should be warmed before using.</li>
  <li>Stay away from any structures still submerged in floodwaters. </li>
  <li>In flooded locations, avoid handling live electrical equipment. </li>
  <li>Examine structures using flashlights if the power is out. There may be flammables there. </li>        
</ul>

  <h3><u>What is your Community's flood risk? </u></h3>
  <p>A community may flood for a variety of reasons, including storm surge, river floods, or significant rainfall. The risk of flooding in a community can also be increased by low-lying or poorly drained areas. Find out how flood hazards affect your area to protect yourself. </p>

<ul>
<li>Find out whether there are any rivers or creeks that commonly flood.</li>
<li>Are you living in a low-lying area?</li>
<li>Determine the elevation of your house.</li>
</ul> 
<p>Obtain or review the local flood map. By entering your address at www.floodsmart.gov, you may determine your overall flood risk. You can access your official FEMA flood zone map online at the Map Service Center of FEMA or by contacting your local office of real estate appraisal.</p>
